Amplitude Data's Google Ads integration enables you to stream your Amplitude event data straight to Google Ads with just a few clicks.

## Considerations

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- Amplitude sends custom events using Amplitude `event_type` as event name.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up event streaming to Google Ads, you need the following:

- A Google Ads Customer ID
- A Google Ads Conversion Action ID
- A [Google Cloud Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Destinations** tab.
2. In the Event Streaming section, click **Google Ads**.
3. Enter a sync name, then click **Create Sync**.

After you create the destination, you must configure the settings.

#### Configure settings

1. On the **Settings** tab, click **Edit**.
2. Enter your [**Google Ads Customer ID**](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en).
3. Enter your [**Google Ads Conversion Action ID**](https://support.google.com/google-ads/thread/105330243?hl=en&sjid=5504033552721490234-EU).
4. Enter your [**Base64 encoded Google Cloud Service Account**](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/oauth/service-accounts).
5. Configure **Send Events** to send events ingested by Amplitude to Google Ads.
      1. To send events, toggle **Send Events** to **Enabled**.
      2. Expand the **Select and filter events** panel, and select which events to send. Amplitude recommends that you send only the events you need in Google Ads, rather than selecting **All Events**.
6. Save when finished.

#### Enable integration

The final step is enabling the destination. You must enable the destination to start streaming events.

1. Navigate back to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit**.
2. Toggle **Status** from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
3. Save when finished.

## Common issues

### Stuck at the authentication step

If you see `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` in your browser's console, disable your ad blocker, clear your browser's cache and cookies, and try to add the connection again.

### "Error: Invalid Customer ID"

Google Ads requires a **Customer ID** to configure as an integration with Amplitude. For more information, see [Find your Google Ads customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en) in Google's documentation.
Keep in mind, **Manager Account Customer ID** is different from the **Customer ID**.

### Insufficient permissions

Amplitude's Google Ads Event Streaming integration requires that your Google Ads Manager account has administrator privileges. This level of permission allows Amplitude to add and remove users from specific user lists in Google Ads.
For Google Ads, Amplitude adds and removes users from a specific user list. As a result, Amplitude needs appropriate permissions to create and delete Google Ads account data.
For more information, see [About access levels in your Google Ads Account
](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) in Google's documentation.
