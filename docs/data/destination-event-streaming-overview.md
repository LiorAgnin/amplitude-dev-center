Event Streaming empowers you to share your Amplitude data seamlessly throughout your entire system. It allows you to utilize the valuable behavioral data in Amplitude to enhance customer profiles and send data to your marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools.

With event streaming, you gain access to user-friendly, configuration-based tools that offer precise control over the data you transmit. You can filter data by user, group, and event properties, ensuring that only the relevant information goes to your other tools. Additionally, you can monitor key metrics such as event volume, latency, and detailed delivery status to assess the performance and reliability of your integration."

## Considerations
- **Billing efficiency:** Amplitude tracks event volume based on distinct events streamed out. If you send the same event to multiple event streaming destinations, it's counted once for billing.
- **Latency target:** Amplitude aims for an end-to-end p95 latency of 60 seconds, with monitoring and alerts in place to support this target.
- **Retry mechanism:** Amplitude addresses intermittent errors through in-memory retries with exponential backoff for initial sends. A robust retry pipeline attempts up to 10 times within a 4-hour window to handle retry errors. Amplitude applies this mechanism to all Event Streaming destinations.
- **Streamlined monitoring and management:** The Event Streaming Debugger UI in Amplitude Data allows users to monitor pending retries and their progress. Expired payloads that exhaust retry attempts are shown within Amplitude. The UI provides insights into error categories and also offers samples of failed payloads for analysis.

## Limitations
- **Forwarding transformed data:** Amplitude event streaming only supports raw (untransformed) events, event properties, and user properties. [Transformed](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/5913315221915-Transformations-Retroactively-modify-your-event-data-structure) events and properties (such as merged properties) aren't supported.
- **User properties format:** All forwarded user properties are currently sent as strings except for the [Braze streaming](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/destinations/braze/) and [Iterable streaming](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/destinations/iterable/) destinations
- **Reserved keywords:** Specific keywords, including "_all" and "_identify," can't be used as event names when streaming events from Amplitude.
- **Historical data:** Amplitude's streaming integrations focus on data from the setup point forward. Historical data isn't included in this process, which ensures that Amplitude transmits only events captured post-configuration.

## FAQs

### What's the difference between Cohort syncing and Event Streaming?

- **Cohort Syncing:** in Amplitude involves automatically maintaining lists of user IDs based on specific criteria or behaviors. This feature is a valuable tool for transferring a list of User IDs from Amplitude to third-party tools like SFMC or Braze. It enables you to explore behavioral targeting and thoroughly analyze the impact of your targeting strategies in downstream destinations. Cohort syncing simplifies the management and updating of these lists, allowing for meaningful actions based on user behavior without manual effort.
- **Event Streaming:** Event Streaming offers more than just cohort syncing. It simplifies your data setup by allowing you to use a single Amplitude configuration to smoothly send data to various platforms, eliminating the need for constant technical adjustments. With Event Streaming, you have precise control, choosing which events, users, or properties to send to each platform, ensuring only important data reaches its destination. Additionally, it enables real-time conversion events, triggering actions in tools like Braze, Customer.io, or SFMC to optimize your targeting and enhance the effectiveness of your initiatives.

### What are some examples of how customers are using Event streaming?

1. **Marco Polo:** Used Event Streaming to power a real-time 'Welcome' email campaign by streaming sign-up events from Amplitude to Braze.
2. **Invoice Simple:** Leveraged Event Streaming for a robust engagement campaign, customizing messaging based on a series of events to enhance engagement effectiveness.

### What happens if I don't see an Event streaming destination on Amplitude Catalog?

1. **Webhook streaming** - You can use [Webhook Event streaming](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/destinations/webhooks-streaming/) integration to send your Amplitude events and user data to custom webhooks. This allows you to send data to a URL of your choice for various use cases. 
2. **Vendor Switch:** Consider switching to a vendor already integrated with Amplitude, which offers similar functionalities. You can find more information in the Amplitude Catalog.
3. **Self-Build or Vendor Request:** You have the option to build the integration yourself using the Amplitude Integration Portal or request the vendor to create it through our integration portal.
